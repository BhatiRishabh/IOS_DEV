### üîπ Main Components

- **ContentView.swift**  
  The main entry point where UI is defined. It contains the search bar and temperature display. It listens to state changes in the `WeatherViewModel`.

- **WeatherViewModel.swift**  
  A view model responsible for API calls to AccuWeather and storing the data. It updates the view on receiving the temperature.

- **WeatherService.swift**  
  This file contains the logic for fetching data from the AccuWeather API. It handles URL construction, API keys, and network responses.

- **ThemeManager.swift** *(Optional)*  
  Handles Light/Dark mode switching. Utilizes `@Environment(\.colorScheme)` and toggles accordingly.

To use this app, you need to obtain a free API key from [AccuWeather Developer Portal](https://developer.accuweather.com/).

1. Create an account.
2. Generate your API key.
3. Add the key to your project (preferably using `.xcconfig` or environment variables).

Example usage in code:
